    //Arrange: set up for success, render component were working with
    render(<CheckoutForm />)

    //Act:select the element(s) and actions/events in question to work with
    const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button');//select our submit button
    userEvent.click(submitButton);//simulate user clicking out button

    

    const success = await screen.findByTestId('successMessage')// this waits for user to click the submit button then finds the element with the test-id of successMessage as an attribute

    

    //Assert: verify that said elements and events are working as expected
    expect(success).toBeInTheDocument();// this checks that the successmessage element is in the document
    expect(success).toBeTruthy();//alternative way of making sure success message is dsiplaying
    expect(success).toBeVisible(); //checks if the elment is seen on the page
    // expect(success).toHaveLength(1); doesnt work because we are not getting an array back

    //ALTERNATIVE METHOD - lends more to manually break so i can verify check is really working
    // const success2 = await screen. getByText(/you have ordered some plants/i)//partial match to look for string of success message
    // expect(success2).toBeInTheDocument();

   // still missing making sure form details are also in the success message
    // even though the code and app isnt validating the form input, just updating with whatver values are insert and rendering in the success message so i dont need to test for that.  as far as i can tell my test check for successmessage rendering (with form details -even if they are empty- since im targeting the parent element (the div holding the text))
});
